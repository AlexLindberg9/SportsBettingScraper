# SportsBettingScraper
Using Selenium and Beautiful Soup, I created 4 different web scrapers that scrape 4 of the most popular sports betting websites in order to find the single best value bet for MLB games. For each website, my scrapers find the moneyline odds for each team playing on a given day. It then calculates the average monelyline for each team using the data from the 4 websites. Finally, it compares every moneyline to the average moneyline for the respective team and returns the moneyline that has the greatest difference (most favorable odds) from the average.
